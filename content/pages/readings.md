What is the difference between Child's first collection of ballads and his third collection of ballads (other than the title)?  
  
What were Child's innovations as a collector and what implications do they have for the study of gender and folk music?  
  
Pick (at least) ten ballads and count the number of men and women informants for each ballad and tabulate the results. What does this elementary exercise suggest about gender and ballads? What reservations do you have about the results?  
  
How did Child's prejudices shape the canon of ballads he created? What role does gender play in the resulting canon?  
  
What difference does it make that Child collected texts but not tunes?  
  
Taking into account Bronson's collections of tunes, what is the difference between a text-based tradition and one based on texts and multiple musical performances? Pick one ballad as a case study.  
  
Choose a Child ballad and analyze its literary effects. Do not neglect to scrutinize its gender politics.  
  
For one of the Child ballads whose sources you have tabulated, note who is the center of the action, who are the villains, what is the outcome?

What are the differences between British and American folk song and ballad repertories and variants?  
  
Compare British and American versions of "Barbara Allen" literarily and musically.  
  
What are the agendas of these collectors? i.e. Lomax, Abrahams, the Warners, Ritchie, etc. Is there a gender difference in the agendas of collectors? Do they collect from different populations?  
  
How are women's experiences depicted by collectors and informants in Great Britain and the U.S.?  
  
What is the relation between progressive politics and folk music?  
  
What are the different qualities of experience and apprehension between recorded sound and the oral tradition? What difference does it make to be able to record informants' music? How do records (i.e. both making them and listening to them) change the musical traditions of folk musicians?  
  
Are the texts of American ballads-both indigenous and imported-more or less violent and/or misogynous than ballads from the British Isles? Can you see/hear any differences between these two repertoires?  
  
Is there a distinct feminine vocal style? The relevant quote is from the country-music authority, Charles Wolfe: "In some communities fiddling was seen as a masculine skill, like shooting; vocal music was more of an art and often passed down through the women. Doubtless more men sang than women fiddled, but there does seem to have been some correlation between women and certain vocal styles. More research needs to be done in this area to further explore whether there is a distinct feminine vocal style."
